============

* Use appropriate formatting
    * 4 Spaces (No tabs PLEASE)
    * Brackets on the same line
    * Space between all keywords, operators and values
    * Long lines are OK - do not break long lines unless there is a logical, tabular break pattern (for example initialising elements in a long array) or if Vanilla does so
    * Generally you should explicitly use `this`.
    * Generally you should use braces { } following `if ()` and `for ()` statements, even if it is only one line.
* Name all variables correctly
* For everyone's sake _****PLEASE****_ use `@Override`.
